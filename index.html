He has no time for those stupid questions but he will take time to speak to you about everything under the Sun. 8. He will send you bad jokes to cheer you up. 9. He will never judge you for your bad jokes. 10. You get to play infinite games with him (sorry, I am yet to play FearBeGone - soon, soon)");

<h2>Dipayan's 26 Years on This Planet</h2>
<div>
  <p> Hey There! <br> Sorry I don't get enough time to talk to you. As an apology (and also because my initially awesome plan to surprise you didn't work 
  because of COVID-19 and my-failed plans-to-stalk-you), please accept this awesome lazily done website! <br> 
  This is exclusively for your birthday purposes. Also to annoy you. You pick. <br> I also hope no body finds this through Google search (restricted web crawlers already but this is on Github so) <br> <br> <br>
	Oh, most important thing. <br> <br> <br>
	Happy Birthday. I know you will have a great year because hard work finds a way. <br> 
	Take care. <br>
